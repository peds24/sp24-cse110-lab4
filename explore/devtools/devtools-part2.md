**Q1:** The function is calculating the sum of two strings, instead of an arithmetic sum, it is just joining num1 and num2 under one string concatenation.

**Q2:** The solution I came up with was to add a `Number()` wrapper for both number variables in order to convert them into numbers so that they can create an arithmetic addition, the result is stored in `result`, and it works as shown by the display on the actual page.
